## Solution

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

**1. Table: customer_orders**
- By looking at the `customer_orders` table, we can notice that the columns `exclusions` and `extras` have missing/blank spaces ' ' and **NULL** values.
<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SantiagoLopezDavid/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/170588432/8327930f-eb37-4fd1-b3bf-56bb00ec6524">

- To clean the table we need to:
  - Create the temporaty table `customer_orders_temp` from `customer_orders` original table.
  - Replace **NULL** values and 'null' strings with ' ' for both columns `exclusions` and `extras`.
 
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
	SELECT order_id, customer_id, pizza_id,
	CASE
		WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
		ELSE exclusions
		END AS exclusions,
	CASE
		WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
		ELSE extras
		END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```
- This is how the clean `customers_orders_temp` table looks like and we will use this table to run all the following queries.

**2. Table: runner_orders**
- By looking at the `runner_orders` table, we can notice that the columns `pickup_time`, `distance`, `duration` and `cancellation` have missing/blank spaces ' ', **NULL** values, bad formatting and wrong data type.
  
<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SantiagoLopezDavid/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/170588432/9b84f3db-5d0f-44c8-951a-9f82dfa89dd1">

- To clean the table we need to:
  - Create the temporaty table `runner_orders_temp` from `runner_orders` original table.
  - Replace **NULL** values and 'null' strings with ' ' for the column `cancellation`.
  - Replace 'null' strings with **NULL** values for the columns `pickup_time`, `distance` and `duration`.
  - In `distance` column, remove "km".
  - In `duration` column, remove "minutes", "minute" and "mins".
 
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
	SELECT order_id, runner_id,
	CASE
		WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
		ELSE pickup_time
		END AS pickup_time,
	CASE
		WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM(TRAILING 'km' FROM distance)
		WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
		ELSE distance
		END AS distance,
	CASE
		WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM(TRAILING 'minutes' FROM duration)
		WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM(TRAILING 'minutes' FROM duration)
		WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM(TRAILING 'minutes' FROM duration)
		WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
		ELSE duration
		END AS duration,
	CASE 
		WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ''
		ELSE cancellation
		END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;
```
- This is how the clean `runner_orders_temp` table looks like and we will use this table to run all the following queries.

- Then, we change the data type of the columns `pickup_time`, `distance` and `duration`.
- **PostgreSQL** doesn‚Äôt allow the implicit type casting from **VARCHAR/TEXT** to **INTEGER**, **FLOAT** or **TIMESTAMP** data type. In PostgreSQL, the **USING** clause is used to cast the **VARCHAR/TEXT** data type these other data types.

```sql
ALTER TABLE runner_orders_temp
ALTER COLUMN pickup_time TYPE TIMESTAMP USING pickup_time::TIMESTAMP WITHOUT time zone,
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE FLOAT USING distance::FLOAT,
ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE INT USING duration::INTEGER;
```

### Pizza Metrics

**1. How many pizzas were ordered?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(pizza_id) AS pizza_count
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```

**Explanation:**
- Use the **COUNT** aggregate function to get the total number of `pizza_id` ordered.
  
**Results and Analysis:**
|pizza_count|
|---|
|14|

- There is a total of 14 pizzas ordered.
  

**2. How many unique customer orders were made?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_order 
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```

**Explanation:**
- Use the **COUNT** aggregate function to get the total number of **DISTINCT** `order_id` ordered.

**Results and Analysis:**
|unique_order|
|---|
|10|

- There is a total of 10 unique `order_id`.

**3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**

```sql
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(order_id) AS count_orders
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE cancellation = ''
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

**Explanation:**
- Use the **COUNT** aggregate function to get the total number of `order_id` per group of `runner_id`.
- Filter the resulting table using the **WHERE** clause by only those rows with a `cancellation = ''`. If the `cancellation` row has any value, it means that the order was cancelled.

**Results and Analysis:**
|runner_id|count_orders|
|---|---|
|1|4|
|2|3|
|3|1|

- Runner 1 has a total of 4 sucessful orders delivered.
- Runner 2 has a total of 3 sucessful orders delivered.
- Runner 3 has a total of 1 sucessful orders delivered.

**4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**

```sql
SELECT ct.pizza_id, pizza_name, COUNT(*) AS pizza_id_count
FROM runner_orders_temp rt
JOIN customer_orders_temp ct ON ct.order_id = rt.order_id
JOIN pizza_names pn ON pn.pizza_id = ct.pizza_id
WHERE cancellation = ''
GROUP BY ct.pizza_id, pizza_name;
```

**Explanation:**

- Use the **COUNT** aggregate function to get the total number of rows per group of `pizza_id` and `pizza_name`.
- **JOIN** the tables `runner_orders_temp` , `customer_orders_temp` and `pizza_names` in order to get the right columns.
- Filter the resulting table using the **WHERE** clause by only those rows with a `cancellation = ''.
- Use the **GROUP BY** clause with `pizza_id` and `pizza_name`.

**Results and Analysis:**

|pizza_id|pizza_name|pizza_id_count|
|---|---|---|
|1|Meatlovers|9|
|2|Vegetarian|3|

- Meatlovers pizza with an id of 1 has a tota of 9 orders delivered.
- Vegetarian pizza with an id of 2 has a tota of 3 orders delivered.

**5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, 
coalesce(sum( case
	when pizza_id = 1 then 1
	end),0) as count_meatlovers,
coalesce(sum( case
	when pizza_id = 2 then 1
	end),0) as count_vegetarian
FROM customer_orders_temp
group by customer_id
order by customer_id;
```

**Explanation:**
- Using a **CASE** statement set a condition for `pizza_id = 1` (Meatlovers), then set a value of 1 for that row.
- Using a **SUM** aggregate function will get the total of `pizza_id = 1`. And in case if the `customer_id` hasn't order a type of pizza, we can use the **COALESCE** function to set the value to 0 instead of it being NULL.
- To create a column for Vegetarian pizza, used the same code but change the condition to `pizza_id = 2`.
- Use a **GROUP BY** clause by `customer_id`.
  
**Results and Analysis:**
|customer_id|count_meatlovers|count_vegetarian|
|---|---|---|
|101|2|1|
|102|2|1|
|103|3|1|
|104|3|0|
|105|0|1|

- Customer with id 101, has ordered a total of 2 Meatlovers pizzas and 1 Vegetarian.
- Customer with id 102, has ordered a total of 2 Meatlovers pizzas and 1 Vegetarian.
- Customer with id 103, has ordered a total of 3 Meatlovers pizzas and 1 Vegetarian.
- Customer with id 104, has ordered a total of 3 Meatlovers pizzas and 0 Vegetarian.
- Customer with id 105, has ordered a total of 0 Meatlovers pizzas and 1 Vegetarian.
  
**6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**
```sql
SELECT order_id, count_pizzas
FROM 
	(SELECT order_id, COUNT(pizza_id) AS count_pizzas,
	RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(pizza_id) DESC) AS rnk
	FROM customer_orders_temp
	WHERE order_id IN 
		(SELECT order_id
		FROM runner_orders_temp
		WHERE cancellation = '')
	GROUP BY order_id
	ORDER BY order_id) AS x
WHERE rnk = 1
```

**Explanation:**
- Create a subquery for those `order_id` which were completed. Meaning that the row `cancellation = ''`.
- This subquery will be part of another subequery named `x`.
- Using the first subquery, we will use it in a **WHERE** clause to filter those `order_id` that are part of completed orders.
- Also, use the **COUNT** function to get the total of `pizza_id` for each `order_id`.
- Next, use the **RANK()** window function. **ORDER BY** the `COUNT(pizza_id)` in a descending order, since we are interested in the highest number.
- Finally, in the main query, which will use the subquery `x`, we will select the `order_id` and `count_pizzas` that has a `rnk = 1`.

**Results and Analysis:**
|order_id|count_pizzas|
|---|---|
|4|3|

- Order_id 4 has the highest number of pizzas delivered.

**7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?**
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
SUM(CASE 
	WHEN exclusions = '' AND extras = '' THEN 1
	ELSE 0
	END) AS no_changes,
SUM(CASE
	WHEN exclusions != '' OR extras != '' THEN 1
	ELSE 0
	END) AS at_least_1_change
FROM customer_orders_temp
WHERE order_id IN 
		(SELECT order_id
		FROM runner_orders_temp
		WHERE cancellation = '')
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
```

**Explanation:**
- Create a subquery for those `order_id` which were completed. Meaning that the row `cancellation = ''`.
- Using the first subquery, we will use it in a **WHERE** clause to filter those `order_id` that are part of completed orders.
- Use a **CASE** statement for when `exclusions` and `extras` are empty and another **CASE** statement for the opposite situation.
- Use a **GROUP BY** clause to filter by `customer_id`.
  
**Results and Analysis:**
|customer_id|no_changes|at_least_1_change|
|---|---|---|
|101|2|0|
|102|3|0|
|103|0|3|
|104|1|2|
|105|0|1|

- Customer 101 has been delivered 2 pizzas with no changes.
- Customer 102 has been delivered 3 pizzas with no changes.
- Customer 103 has been delivered 3 pizzas with at least 1 change.
- Customer 104 has been delivered 1 pizza with no changes and 2 pizzas with at least 1 change.
- Customer 105 has been delivered 1 pizza with at least 1 change.
