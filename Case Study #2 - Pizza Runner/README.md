## Solution

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

**1.Table: Customer_orders**
- By looking at the `customer_orders` table, we can notice that the columns `exclusions` and `extras` have missing/blank spaces ' ' and **NULL** values.

- To clean the table we need to:
  - Create the temporaty table `customer_orders_temp` from `customer_orders` original table.
  - Replace **NULL** values and 'null' strings with ' ' for both columns `exclusions` and `extras`.
 
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
	SELECT order_id, customer_id, pizza_id,
	CASE
		WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
		ELSE exclusions
		END AS exclusions,
	CASE
		WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
		ELSE extras
		END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```
- This is how the clean `customers_orders_temp` table looks like and we will use this table to run all the following queries.
