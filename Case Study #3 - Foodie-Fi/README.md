## Solution

**Customer Journey**

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about some customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id, s.plan_id, plan_name, price, s.start_date
FROM subscriptions s
LEFT JOIN plans ON plans.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE s.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.plan_id
```

**1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) customer_count
FROM subscriptions;
```
**Explanation:**

- **COUNT** the **DISTINCT** `customer_id` in the table `subscriptions`.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="124" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0eb79d3-ff63-4537-9f06-b368c056e85c">

- Foodie-Fi has had a total of 1000 unique customers.

---

**2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value**

```sql
SELECT
EXTRACT(month FROM start_date) AS month_num,
TO_CHAR(start_date,'Month') AS month_str,
COUNT(plan_id) AS plan_count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY month_num,month_str
ORDER BY month_num;
```
**Explanation:**

- Use the **EXTRACT** function to get the 'month' field as a number from `start_date`.
- Use the **TO_CHAR** function to convert the `start_date` into the **'Month'** string.
- **COUNT** the number of `plan_id` per `month_num` and `month_str`.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cda9ae7-93d0-455b-b8ac-1baa9c37efa7">

- The month with the highest trial plan start date is March with a count of 94.
- The month with the lowest trial plan start date is February with a count of 68.

---

**3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name**

```sql
SELECT s.plan_id, plan_name,
COUNT(*) plan_count
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans on s.plan_id = plans.plan_id
WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM start_date) > 2020
GROUP BY s.plan_id, plan_name
ORDER BY s.plan_id;
```
**Explanation:**

- **JOIN** the tables `subscriptions` and `plans` to get the `plan_name` for each `plan_id`.
- Use the **WHERE** clause to filter the resulting table to those `start_date` that have a year greater than 2020.
- **COUNT** each of the results for each `plan_id` and `plan_name`.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbbf34e0-bfed-4897-904d-4daa62d3e6d6">

- Plan 1 or Basic Monthly has 8 subscriptions after the year 2020. The lowest of the year 2021.
- Plan 2 or Pro Monthly has 60 subscriptions after the year 2020.
- Plan 3 or Pro Annual has 63 subscriptions after the year 2020.
- Plan 4 of churn has a count of 71 customers. Churn is the highest count for the year 2021.
---

**4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?**

```sql
SELECT ROUND((count_churn::numeric/customer_count::numeric)*100,1) AS churn_percentage,
count_churn
FROM
	(SELECT 
	SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 4 THEN 1 END) AS count_churn,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
	FROM subscriptions) AS x
```
**Explanation:**

- Use a subquery to **COUNT** the total of unique `customer_id` and **SUMM** the total of `plan_id = 4` from the database.
- In the main query, use the two variables from the subquery to calculate the `churn_percentage`.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="233" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b47b7528-4108-457f-a0f6-85318091ed67">

- The customer churn count is 307 in total. Representing a 30.7% of the total count of unique customers.
---

**5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?**

```sql
WITH cte_churn AS
	(SELECT *
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 4),
cte_trial AS
	(SELECT *
	 FROM subscriptions
	 WHERE plan_id=0),
cte_churn_after_trial AS 
	(SELECT 
	COUNT(cc.customer_id) AS customer_count
	FROM cte_churn cc
	JOIN cte_trial ct ON ct.customer_id = cc.customer_id
	WHERE cc.start_date - ct.start_date = 7)
SELECT customer_count,
ROUND(customer_count::numeric/COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id::numeric)*100,2) AS percentage_churn
FROM subscriptions, cte_churn_after_trial
GROUP BY customer_count;
```
**Explanation:**
- Create a **CTE** to get the `customer_id` where the `plan-id = 4`. Meaning they cancelled the subscription.
- Create a **CTE** to get the `customer_id` where the `plan-id = 0`. Meaning they started the free trail.
- Both these **CTEs** will have the `start_date` for the plans. We can use another **CTE** to calculate the difference between these dates and using the **WHERE** clause, filter the `customer_id` which difference between the `start_date` from their free trail and the date they decided to cancelled.
- Finally, use this `customer_count` to calculate the `percentage_churn` with all the unique `customer_id` from the table `subscriptions`.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="256" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64290e0f-5c9a-4d03-a8e1-b17092f8b6af">

- There are 92 customers who cancelled their subscriptions right after their free trail period ended. This number is only 9.2% from the total count of customers.

---

**6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?**

```sql
WITH cte AS 
	(SELECT customer_id, plan_id, start_date,
	LEAD(plan_id) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY plan_id) AS next_plan_id
	FROM subscriptions)
SELECT 
next_plan_id,
COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count,
ROUND(COUNT(customer_id)::numeric/
	  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions)*100,2) AS percentage
FROM cte
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY next_plan_id
ORDER BY next_plan_id;
```
**Explanation:**

- With a **CTE**, get every `next_plan_id` form every row.
- Using that `CTE` count the number of `customer_id` per group of `next_plan_id`. This would calculate the amount of customers converted after their free trail period.
- Calculate the `percentage` of each grup.
- Using the **WHERE** clause, filter the resulting table only by those rows that had the `next_plan_id` right after the `plan_id = 0`.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d54482f-903c-489d-9228-092e7766474a">

- There is a total of 1000 unique customers.
- After the initial free trial:
  - 546 customers stay in the basic monthly plan, which represents 54.6% of the total.
  - 325 customers stay in the pro monthly plan, which represents 32.5% of the total.
  - 37 customers stay in the pro annual plan, which represents 3.7% of the total.
  - 92 customers decided to cancelled their plan after the free trail, which represents 9.2% of the total.
- Most of the customer stay in the basic monthly plan, which meand that more than half the customers enjoy the service and decided to keep a plan but not the pro monthly.
- The next big group is customer who decided to keep their subscription as pro monthly. This could be because their did not bother to change their plan.
  
**7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?**

```sql
WITH cte AS 
	(SELECT customer_id,
	MAX(plan_id) AS final_plan
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE start_date < '2020-12-31'
	GROUP BY customer_id
	ORDER BY customer_id)
SELECT final_plan AS plan_id,
COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count,
ROUND(COUNT(customer_id)::numeric/
	  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions)*100,2) AS percentage
FROM cte
GROUP BY plan_id
ORDER BY plan_id;
```
**Explanation:**

- With a **CTE**, get the **MAX** `plan_id` for each customer. This would be the last plan per customer for the year 2020.
- Using that `CTE` count the number of `customer_id` per group of `plan_id`. This would calculate the amount of customers per plan group by the end of the year.
- Calculate the `percentage` of each grup.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="298" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/573a2881-b3ce-4d9a-847a-92a26be11603">

- At the end of the year 2020:
  - 19 customers are in a free trail plan.
  - 224 customers are in the basic monthly plan. This represents a 22.4% of the total.
  - 327 customer are in the pro monthly plan. The highest percentage for the year, 32.7%.
  - 195 customers purchased the pro annual plan.
  - Finally 235 customers finished the year cancelling their plans.
---

**8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM
	(SELECT customer_id, start_date,
	MAX(plan_id)
	FROM subscriptions
	GROUP BY customer_id, start_date
	HAVING MAX(plan_id) = 3 AND start_date < '2020-12-31'
	ORDER BY customer_id) AS x;
```
**Explanation:**

- Use a subquery to filter the table `subscriptions` by only those `customer_id` that have a `plan_id = 3` by the end of the year 2020.
- In the main query **COUNT** the number of `customer_id`.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1afc2e88-2493-48b6-952e-8548d9b12034">

- There is a total of 195 customer who upgraded to the pro annual plan in the year 2020.

**9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to change to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?**

```sql
WITH cte_trail AS
	(SELECT *
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 0),
cte_annual AS 
	(SELECT *
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 3)
SELECT 
ROUND(AVG(ca.start_date - ct.start_date)::numeric,2) AS date_diff_avg
FROM cte_trail ct
JOIN cte_annual ca ON ct.customer_id = ca.customer_id;
```
**Explanation:**

- Using two separate **CTEs** get separate the `customer_id` and `start_date` for each of the two plans to be used.
- Using the aggregate functon **AVG** calculate the average of the difference between the `start_date` of `plan_id = 3` and the `start_date` of `plan_id = 0`.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="109" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8fee030-69b6-4cbb-96b5-89c2734d83df">

- On average it takes ~105 days for a customer to change to an annual plan from their free trail plan. 

---

**10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)**

```sql
WITH cte_trail AS
	(SELECT *
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 0),
cte_annual AS 
	(SELECT *
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 3),
cte_bins AS 
	(SELECT ct.start_date AS trail_sd, 
	ca.start_date AS annual_sd,
	ca.start_date - ct.start_date AS date_diff,
	WIDTH_BUCKET(ca.start_date - ct.start_date, 0, 365, 12) AS bin
	FROM cte_trail AS ct
	JOIN cte_annual AS ca ON ct.customer_id = ca.customer_id
	ORDER BY date_diff)
SELECT
((bin - 1) * 30 || ' - ' || bin * 30 || ' days') AS period, 
COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM cte_bins
GROUP BY bin
ORDER BY bin;
```
**Explanation:**

- Using two separate **CTEs** get separate the `customer_id` and `start_date` for each of the two plans to be used.
- A third **CTE** will be used with the function **WIDTH_BUCKET** to separate the `date_diff` of each customer into 12 different bins/buckets.
- Using the last **CTE** , **COUNT** the amount of `customer_id` for each bin.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="224" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04af1601-e67a-4ee2-81e6-bcb77550870c">

- Most of the customers who change their plans from the free trail to annual do it within the first 30 days of starting the trail period.
- There is a lower chance for a customer to change from a free trail to an annual plan if more than 210 days have gone by.

---
**11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?**

```sql
WITH cte_basic AS
	(SELECT *
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 1),
cte_pro AS 
	(SELECT *
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 2)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM cte_basic cb
JOIN cte_pro cp ON cb.customer_id = cp.customer_id
WHERE cb.start_date - cp.start_date > 0
AND cb.start_date < '2020-12-31' 
AND cp.start_date < '2020-12-31';
```
**Explanation:**

- Using two separate **CTEs** get separate the `customer_id` and `start_date` for each of the two plans to be used.
- Filter the table in the **WHERE** clause by those rows in which the difference between the `start_date` of 'basic monthly' and 'pro monthly' is grater than 0 (if its greater than 0 it meand that the `start_date` for the 'basic monthly' is later than the 'pro monthly' plan). Also, filter by those `start_date` before '2020-12-31'.

**Results and Analysis:**

<img width="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa095fed-453f-44c6-9c9a-bf8879e28573">

- There are 0 customers who dowgraded from a pro monthly to a basic montly plan in 2020.
