**2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value**

```sql
SELECT
EXTRACT(month FROM start_date) AS month_num,
TO_CHAR(start_date,'Month') AS month_str,
COUNT(plan_id) AS plan_count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY month_num,month_str
ORDER BY month_num;
```
